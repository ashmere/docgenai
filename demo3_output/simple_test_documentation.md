## Overview

The `simple_test.py` script defines a simple Python script containing a single function `hello()` that returns the string "Hello, World!". This script is intended for basic testing and demonstration purposes.

## Key Components

- **`hello()`**: A function that returns the string "Hello, World!".

## Architecture

The architecture of this script is straightforward. The script consists of a single Python file, `simple_test.py`, which contains a single function `hello()`. The function `hello()` is defined to return the string "Hello, World!".

Here's a diagram illustrating the architecture:
