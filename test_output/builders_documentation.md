# Documentation: builders.py

## Overview

This code provides a set of pre-built chain configurations for generating and enhancing documentation, as well as an architecture diagram. These chains are designed to help users generate detailed, well-structured documentation for their code, with an optional enhancement step and support for diagrams in the future.

## Key Components

- **ChainBuilder**: A class that provides static methods to create various types of chains.

- **PromptChain**: A class representing a sequence of steps for generating documentation.

- **PromptStep**: A class representing a single step in a chain, including the prompt template and configuration.

- **StepConfig**: A class for configuring the behavior of a step, including timeout settings.

## Architecture

The `ChainBuilder` class contains static methods to create different types of chains:

- **simple_documentation_chain()**: Creates a single-step chain for basic documentation generation.

- **enhanced_documentation_chain()**: Creates a multi-step chain that includes analysis, generation, and enhancement of documentation.

- **architecture_diagram_chain()**: A future enhancement that would include analysis, textual description, diagram specification, and combination into final documentation.

- **custom_chain(steps, name, fail_fast)**: Allows users to define a custom chain with a list of `PromptStep` objects, an optional name, and a fail-fast setting.

- **get_available_chains()**: Returns a dictionary of available chains and their descriptions.

- **create_chain(chain_type, **kwargs)**: Creates a chain based on the provided `chain_type` and additional keyword arguments for custom chains.

## Usage Examples

Here's how you can use the `ChainBuilder` to create a simple documentation chain:

```python
from docgenai.chaining.builders import ChainBuilder

chain = ChainBuilder.simple_documentation_chain()

To create an enhanced documentation chain, you can use:

```

```python
chain = ChainBuilder.enhanced_documentation_chain()

For a custom chain, you would need to define your own steps and configuration:

```

```python
from docgenai.chaining.builders import ChainBuilder, PromptStep, StepConfig

steps = [
    PromptStep(
        name="step1",
        prompt_template="Your prompt template here",
        config=StepConfig(timeout=300.0),
        metadata={"type": "custom", "version": "1.0"},
    ),
    PromptStep(
        name="step2",
        prompt_template="Another prompt template",
        config=StepConfig(timeout=180.0),
        metadata={"type": "custom", "version": "1.0"},
    ),
]

custom_chain = ChainBuilder.custom_chain(steps=steps, name="CustomChain", fail_fast=True)

```

## Dependencies

This code relies on the following external modules:

- `typing` for type annotations.

- `src.docgenai.chaining.chain` for the `PromptChain` and `PromptStep` classes.

## Configuration

No configuration options are provided in the code. However, `StepConfig` allows users to set timeout settings for each step.

## Error Handling

The `ChainBuilder` class raises a `ValueError` if an unknown `chain_type` is provided to the `create_chain` method. Common issues include incorrect `chain_type` values or issues with the `depends_on` attribute in `PromptStep`.

## Performance Considerations

The performance of the chains is dependent on the complexity of the code and the responses from the prompts. The `timeout` settings in `StepConfig` can help manage performance, allowing users to set limits on how long each step can take. Additionally, the `fail_fast` setting can help in scenarios where early failure is acceptable.

## Architecture Analysis

## Architectural Patterns

The code primarily uses a **Builder Pattern** to construct complex objects (`PromptChain`) in a step-by-step manner. This pattern is evident in the `ChainBuilder` class, where each method (`simple_documentation_chain`, `enhanced_documentation_chain`, `architecture_diagram_chain`, and `custom_chain`) constructs a specific `PromptChain` with predefined or user-defined steps.

## Code Organization

The code is organized into several parts:

- **Imports**: Standard library imports and internal module imports.

- **ChainBuilder Class**: The main class containing static methods to build different types of `PromptChain` configurations.

- **Static Methods**: Methods like `simple_documentation_chain`, `enhanced_documentation_chain`, and `architecture_diagram_chain` define specific chains.

- **Class Methods**: The `create_chain` method allows for dynamic creation of chains based on a type string.

- **PromptChain and PromptStep Classes**: These are used to define the structure and steps of the chains.

## Data Flow

Data flows through the system primarily through the `PromptChain` and `PromptStep` objects. The `PromptChain` is initialized with a list of `PromptStep` objects, and each step depends on the completion of previous steps. Data is passed between steps via the `depends_on` attribute and the `prompt_template` attribute, where the code to be documented or analyzed is inserted.

## Dependencies (2)

- **Internal Dependencies**: The `PromptChain` and `PromptStep` classes are defined within the same module, and `ChainBuilder` depends on them.

- **External Dependencies**: The `PromptChain` and `PromptStep` classes rely on the `StepConfig` and `metadata` provided by the user or predefined in the builder methods.

## Interfaces

Public interfaces are exposed through the `get_available_chains` and `create_chain` methods, allowing external entities to interact with the `ChainBuilder` class to generate different chains.

## Extensibility

The code is highly extensible. New chains can be added by defining new static methods in the `ChainBuilder` class, and new types of `PromptChain` can be created by modifying the `PromptStep` configurations. The `create_chain` method handles the creation of chains based on a type string, allowing for dynamic chain creation at runtime.

## Design Principles

- **SOLID Principles**: The code adheres to several SOLID principles:
  - **Single Responsibility Principle**: The `ChainBuilder` class handles chain creation, while `PromptChain` and `PromptStep` handle chain structure and steps.
  - **Open/Closed Principle**: The `ChainBuilder` class is open for extension (new chains can be added) but closed for modification (existing code is not modified to add new chains).
  - **Liskov Substitution Principle**: The `PromptChain` and `PromptStep` classes are designed in a way that they can be substituted for each other in the context of the `ChainBuilder` class.
  - **Interface Segregation Principle**: The `PromptChain` and `PromptStep` classes are designed to provide a clear and well-defined interface for the `ChainBuilder` class to interact with.
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle**: The `ChainBuilder` class does not depend on concrete implementations of `PromptChain` and `PromptStep`; instead, it depends on abstractions.

- **Separation of Concerns**: The code is well-separated into classes and methods, each with a single responsibility.

## Potential Improvements

- **Configuration Management**: Consider adding more robust configuration management for chains, possibly through a configuration file or a database, to allow for dynamic chain configurations without recompiling the code.

- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling in the `create_chain` method to provide more informative error messages when an unknown chain type is requested.

- **Documentation**: Enhance the documentation of the `ChainBuilder` class and its methods to make it clearer how to use them and what each parameter does.

- **Testing**: Implement unit tests for the `ChainBuilder` class and its methods to ensure that the chains are created correctly and that errors are handled appropriately.
