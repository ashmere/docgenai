# Documentation: chain.py

## Overview

The `PromptChain` class in the `src/docgenai/chaining/chain.py` file is designed to orchestrate the execution of a sequence of `PromptStep` objects, each representing a specific step in an AI generation process. The chain can handle dependencies between steps, manage parallel execution, and includes error handling and retry logic.
It uses a logging mechanism to report the status of each step and the overall chain execution.

## Key Components

- **PromptChain Class**: Orchestrates execution of multiple prompt steps in sequence.
  - **`**init**` Method**: Initializes the chain with a list of `PromptStep` objects, a name for the chain, and configuration options for failure behavior and parallel execution.
  - **`_validate_chain` Method**: Validates the chain configuration to ensure there are no duplicate step names and that all dependencies are valid.
  - **`_check_circular_dependencies` Method**: Checks for circular dependencies in the chain.
  - **`_get_execution_order` Method**: Determines the execution order based on dependencies.
  - **`execute` Method**: Executes the chain by calling the provided `model_fn` with prompts from each step, updating the `ChainContext` with results and metadata.
  - **`get_step` Method**: Retrieves a `PromptStep` by name.
  - **`add_step` Method**: Adds a new `PromptStep` to the chain.
  - **`remove_step` Method**: Removes a `PromptStep` from the chain by name.
  - **`step_names` Property**: Returns a list of all step names in the chain.
  - **`**repr**` Method**: Provides a string representation of the chain.

## Architecture

The `PromptChain` class works by:

1. Validating the chain configuration to ensure step names are unique and dependencies are valid.

2. Determining the execution order based on dependencies.

3. Executing each step in the determined order, capturing results and errors.

4. Logging the status of each step and the overall chain execution.

## Usage Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `PromptChain` class:

```python
from src.docgenai.chaining.chain import PromptChain, PromptStep

# Define some steps

step1 = PromptStep(name="Step 1", prompt="First step", depends_on=[])
step2 = PromptStep(name="Step 2", prompt="Second step", depends_on=["Step 1"])

# Create a chain with the steps

chain = PromptChain(steps=[step1, step2])

# Define a mock model function for demonstration

def mock_model_fn(prompt: str) -> str:
    return f"Processed: {prompt}"

# Execute the chain

result = chain.execute(model_fn=mock_model_fn)
print(result)

```

## Dependencies

- The `PromptChain` class depends on the `PromptStep` class and uses the `ChainContext` class for context management.

- External dependencies include the `logging` module for logging purposes.

## Configuration

- The `PromptChain` class can be configured with a `name`, `fail_fast` flag (to stop on first failure), and `max_parallel` (future feature for parallel execution).

## Error Handling

- Errors during step execution are logged, and if `fail_fast` is enabled, the chain execution stops on the first error.

- The `ChainContext` is used to manage errors and results, and it is updated during the execution of each step.

## Performance Considerations

- The chain execution is designed to be efficient, with each step executed sequentially based on dependencies.

- Parallel execution is planned for future enhancements, but is currently limited to a maximum of one step at a time.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to using the `PromptChain` class, including its main functionalities, configuration options, and error handling mechanisms.

## Architecture Analysis

## Architectural Analysis

### 1. Architectural Patterns

The code does not explicitly use a known design pattern like MVC, Observer, Factory, etc. It follows a more traditional object-oriented approach with a class-based structure.

### 2. Code Organization

The code is organized into a single file, `chain.py`, which contains the `PromptChain` class and related helper functions. The class is responsible for orchestrating the execution of multiple `PromptStep` objects.

### 3. Data Flow

- **Initialization**: The `PromptChain` class is initialized with a list of `PromptStep` objects, configuration options, and a name.

- **Validation**: The `_validate_chain` method checks for duplicate step names and invalid dependencies.

- **Execution Order**: The `_get_execution_order` method determines the order in which steps should be executed based on dependencies.

- **Execution**: The `execute` method starts the chain execution, logs the progress, and handles errors.

- **Step Management**: The `add_step` and `remove_step` methods allow dynamic modification of the chain.

### 4. Dependencies

- **Internal Dependencies**: The `PromptChain` class depends on the `PromptStep` class and related modules for its functionality.

- **External Dependencies**: The code uses the `logging` module for logging purposes.

### 5. Interfaces

- **Public Methods**: The `execute`, `add_step`, `remove_step`, and `get_step` methods are public interfaces exposed by the `PromptChain` class.

- **Configuration**: The `**init**` method allows configuring the chain with steps, name, fail_fast setting, and max_parallelism.

### 6. Extensibility

- **Adding/Removing Steps**: The `add_step` and `remove_step` methods provide extensibility by allowing dynamic modification of the chain.

- **Configuration Flexibility**: The `**init**` method provides flexibility in configuring the chain with different parameters.

### 7. Design Principles

- **SOLID Principles**: The code adheres to some SOLID principles, particularly Single Responsibility Principle (the `PromptChain` class handles chain orchestration), Open/Closed Principle (open for extension but closed for modification).

- **Separation of Concerns**: The code separates concerns by having the `PromptChain` class handle the orchestration of steps and the `PromptStep` class handle individual step logic.

### 8. Potential Improvements

- **Parallel Execution**: The current implementation only supports sequential execution. Future work could include support for parallel execution of steps.

- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling to provide more detailed feedback and better user experience.

- **Logging**: Enhance logging to include more detailed information about each step's execution.

- **Configuration Validation**: Improve configuration validation to handle more edge cases and provide clearer error messages.

Overall, the code is well-structured and follows good software design principles, though there is room for improvement in terms of extensibility and detailed error handling.
