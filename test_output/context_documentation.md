# Documentation: context.py

## Overview

The `ChainContext` class in the `src/docgenai/chaining/context.py` file is designed to manage the state and results of a sequence of prompt chain executions. It provides a structured way to store and retrieve the outputs and metadata from each step of the chain, as well as to track the overall execution time and status of the chain.

## Key Components

- **StepResult**: A data class representing the result of a single chain step, including the step name, output, metadata, execution time, error, and timestamp.

- **ChainContext**: The main class that manages the chain context. It includes methods to set and retrieve inputs, add results, and manage metadata. It also provides properties to check the status of the chain, such as whether it is complete, the number of successful and failed steps, and the total execution time.

## Architecture

The `ChainContext` class is initialized with optional initial inputs and uses a dictionary to store the results of each step. Each `StepResult` is added to the `results` dictionary with the step name as the key. The `metadata` dictionary is used to store additional information about the chain execution.
The `execution_time` property calculates the total time taken for the chain to execute, and the `is_complete` property checks if the chain has finished.

## Usage Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `ChainContext` class:

```python

# Initialize ChainContext with some initial inputs

context = ChainContext(initial_inputs={"prompt": "Tell me a story."})

# Define a step result

step_result = StepResult(step_name="generate_story", output="Once upon a time...")

# Add the step result to the context

context.add_result(step_result)

# Get the output of a specific step

output = context.get_output("generate_story")
print(output)  # Output: Once upon a time...

# Check if the chain execution is complete

if context.is_complete:
    print("Chain execution is complete.")

# Get all successful step outputs

successful_outputs = context.get_all_outputs()
print(successful_outputs)  # Output: {'generate_story': 'Once upon a time...'}

```

## Dependencies

The `ChainContext` class depends on the `dataclasses` and `time` modules from the Python standard library.

## Configuration

No external configuration options or environment variables are required to use the `ChainContext` class.

## Error Handling

Errors are handled by setting the `error` attribute of a `StepResult` object. If an error occurs during the execution of a step, the `error` attribute should be set to a string describing the error. The `get_failed_steps` method can be used to retrieve a list of steps that have failed.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance, consider using a more efficient data structure for storing results if the chain execution involves a large number of steps. Additionally, ensure that the `metadata` dictionary does not grow too large, as this could impact performance.

## Architecture Analysis

## Architectural Analysis of `context.py`

### 1. Architectural Patterns

The code does not explicitly use a known design pattern such as MVC, Observer, Factory, etc. Instead, it follows a simple object-oriented approach with a `ChainContext` class that manages the state and results of a chain of prompts.

### 2. Code Organization

The code is organized into several parts:

- **Imports**: Includes standard libraries (`time`, `dataclasses`, `typing`) and custom classes (`StepResult` and `ChainContext`).

- **Data Classes**: `StepResult` is defined using `@dataclass`, which helps in automatically generating special methods like `**init**`, `**repr**`, etc.

- **Main Class**: `ChainContext` contains methods to manage inputs, results, metadata, and execution status.

### 3. Data Flow

- **Inputs**: Managed through `set_input` and `get_input` methods.

- **Results**: Stored in a dictionary (`self.results`) and managed through `add_result` and `get_result` methods.

- **Metadata**: Managed through `set_metadata` and `get_metadata` methods.

- **Execution Status**: Tracked through `start_time`, `end_time`, and properties like `is_complete`, `execution_time`, etc.

### 4. Dependencies

- **Internal Dependencies**: Methods within `ChainContext` depend on each other and on the `StepResult` class.

- **External Dependencies**: Minimal, relying only on standard library modules (`time` and `dataclasses`).

### 5. Interfaces

- **Public Methods**:
  - `set_input`, `get_input`
  - `add_result`, `get_result`, `get_output`, `has_result`, `get_all_outputs`, `get_failed_steps`
  - `set_metadata`, `get_metadata`
  - `mark_complete`
  - `to_dict`

- **Properties**: `execution_time`, `is_complete`, `step_count`, `success_count`, `failure_count`

### 6. Extensibility

The code is designed to be easily extensible. For example, adding new methods to `ChainContext` or modifying the data structures would be straightforward. The use of `dataclass` for `StepResult` ensures that it can be easily extended with new attributes if needed.

### 7. Design Principles

- **SOLID Principles**: The code follows some of the SOLID principles:
  - **Single Responsibility Principle**: `ChainContext` handles the context for the chain, while `StepResult` handles the result of a single step.
  - **Open/Closed Principle**: The `ChainContext` class is open for extension (e.g., adding new methods) but closed for modification.
  - **Liskov Substitution Principle**: The `ChainContext` class and `StepResult` class are designed in a way that they can be substituted for each other in the context of the application.

- **Separation of Concerns**: The code separates concerns such as managing inputs, results, metadata, and execution status.

### 8. Potential Improvements

- **Use of Design Patterns**: Consider using a design pattern like the **Observer Pattern** to notify external systems or components about the completion of a chain step.

- **Enhanced Metadata**: Expand the `metadata` dictionary to include more detailed information about each step's execution.

- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling to provide more informative errors and handle edge cases better.

- **Testing**: Adding unit tests to ensure the reliability and maintainability of the code.

Overall, the code is well-structured and follows good software design principles, making it easy to understand and extend.
