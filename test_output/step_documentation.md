# Documentation: step.py

## Overview

This code defines a `PromptStep` class, which represents an individual step in a chain of prompts. Each step can depend on outputs from previous steps and can transform or combine those outputs in various ways. The `PromptStep` class provides methods to check dependencies, build prompts, and execute steps with retries.

## Key Components

- **PromptStep**: The main class representing a step in the prompt chain.

- **StepConfig**: A dataclass for configuring each step, including timeout, retry count, retry delay, and whether the step is required.

- **can_execute**: A method to check if the step can be executed based on the current context.

- **get_missing_dependencies**: A method to get a list of missing dependencies.

- **build_prompt**: A method to build the prompt for this step using the context.

- **execute**: A method to execute this step, calling the AI model and applying a transformation function if provided.

## Architecture

The `PromptStep` class is designed to work with a `ChainContext` to manage the state of the chain and retrieve outputs from previous steps. The `execute` method handles retries if the initial attempt fails, and it also captures metadata about the execution.

## Usage Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `PromptStep` class:

```python
from src.docgenai.chaining.step import PromptStep, StepConfig
from src.docgenai.chaining.context import ChainContext

def my_model_fn(prompt: str) -> str:
    # This is a placeholder for the actual model function
    return "Output from the model"

config = StepConfig(timeout=60.0, retry_count=2, retry_delay=2.0)
step = PromptStep(
    name="Step1",
    prompt_template="This is a prompt template with {variable}.",
    depends_on=["Step2"],
    transform_fn=lambda output, context: output,
    config=config,
)

context = ChainContext(inputs={"variable": "example_value"})
context.add_output("Step2", "Output from Step2")

result = step.execute(context, my_model_fn)
print(result)

In this example, a `PromptStep` is created with a specific configuration and a custom `transform_fn`. The `execute` method is called with a `ChainContext` and a model function `my_model_fn`.

```

## Dependencies

- `dataclasses`: For creating dataclass instances.

- `time`: For timing the execution of steps.

- `typing`: For type hints.

## Configuration

- `timeout`: Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for the AI model response.

- `retry_count`: Number of times to retry the request if it fails.

- `retry_delay`: Delay (in seconds) between retries.

- `required`: Whether the step is required for the chain to proceed.

- `skip_on_failure`: Whether the step should be skipped if it fails.

## Error Handling

Errors during the execution of a step are caught and raised as `ValueError` with a detailed error message. The `execution` method also captures metadata about the execution, including the dependencies and the attempt number.

## Performance Considerations

- The `PromptStep` class is designed to handle asynchronous execution, with retries in case of failure.

- The `build_prompt` method collects variables from the context and formats them into the prompt template.

- The `execute` method handles retries with a delay between attempts.

- Performance can be impacted by the complexity of the `transform_fn` and the performance of the AI model.

## Architecture Analysis

## Architectural Analysis of `step.py`

### 1. Architectural Patterns

The code does not explicitly use a known design pattern like MVC, Observer, Factory, etc. It follows a more traditional object-oriented approach with a focus on encapsulating functionality within classes and methods.

### 2. Code Organization

The code is organized into several parts:

- **Imports**: Standard library imports and internal module imports.

- **Data Classes**: `StepConfig` is defined using `@dataclass`.

- **Main Class**: `PromptStep` contains the main functionality.

- **Methods**:
  - `**init**`: Initializes the step with various parameters.
  - `can_execute`: Checks if the step can be executed based on dependencies.
  - `get_missing_dependencies`: Lists dependencies that are not satisfied.
  - `build_prompt`: Constructs the prompt using context variables.
  - `execute`: Executes the step, handles retries, and captures metadata.
  - `**repr**`: Provides a string representation of the step.

### 3. Data Flow

- **Inputs**: Parameters passed to `**init**` and `build_prompt`.

- **Outputs**: `StepResult` returned by `execute`.

- **Dependencies**: Managed through `depends_on` and `can_execute`.

- **Transformations**: Handled by `transform_fn` in `execute`.

### 4. Dependencies

- **Internal Dependencies**: Methods within `PromptStep` depend on each other.

- **External Dependencies**: `model_fn` is an external dependency passed to `execute`.

### 5. Interfaces

- **Public API**: Main interface is `PromptStep` with `execute` method.

- **Configuration**: `StepConfig` provides configuration options.

### 6. Extensibility

- **Configuration**: `StepConfig` allows easy modification of step behavior.

- **Transformations**: `transform_fn` can be overridden to customize output processing.

- **New Steps**: Adding new steps can be done by creating new instances of `PromptStep`.

### 7. Design Principles

- **SOLID Principles**: The code adheres to some of the SOLID principles:
  - **Single Responsibility Principle**: `PromptStep` handles individual step logic.
  - **Open/Closed Principle**: Modifications to `PromptStep` can be made without changing existing code.
  - **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Not explicitly violated but could be extended to support more complex behaviors.
  - **Interface Segregation Principle**: Not explicitly violated but could be extended to support more specific interfaces.
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Not explicitly violated but could be extended to support more flexible dependency management.

- **Separation of Concerns**: Different responsibilities (prompt construction, execution, transformation) are separated into different methods.

### 8. Potential Improvements

- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and logging to provide more informative feedback.

- **Configuration Management**: Consider using a more flexible configuration management system to handle complex configurations.

- **Testing**: Add unit tests to cover different scenarios and edge cases.

- **Extensibility**: Consider adding more hooks or interfaces to facilitate more complex behaviors or integrations.

Overall, the code is well-structured and follows good software design principles, making it extensible and maintainable.
