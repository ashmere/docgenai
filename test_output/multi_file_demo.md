# Multi-File Analysis Demo

**Files analyzed:** builders.py, chain.py, step.py, context.py

## Analysis Result



### 1. Overall Purpose of the Module

The module `src/docgenai/chaining` appears to be designed for creating and managing a sequence of prompts (steps) that are executed in a chain to generate documentation for code. The primary goal is to automate the process of generating detailed, structured documentation from code snippets using AI models. The module provides a flexible framework to define and configure different chains of prompts, each tailored for specific documentation generation patterns.

### 2. How Files Interact with Each Other

- **`builders.py`**: This file defines classes and functions to build pre-defined chains for common documentation generation patterns. It provides methods to create chains like `simple_documentation_chain`, `enhanced_documentation_chain`, and `architecture_diagram_chain`.

- **`chain.py`**: This file contains the main orchestrator for the chain, `PromptChain`, which manages the execution of multiple `PromptStep` objects. It ensures that steps are executed in the correct order based on dependencies and handles errors and retries.

- **`step.py`**: This file defines individual steps within the chain, `PromptStep`, which can depend on the outputs of previous steps. Each step has a `prompt_template` and can have a `transform_fn` to modify the output.

- **`context.py`**: This file defines the context for the chain, `ChainContext`, which manages the state and results of the chain execution. It includes methods to add results, check for dependencies, and store metadata.

### 3. Main Classes and Their Relationships

- **`PromptChain`**: Orchestrates the execution of multiple `PromptStep` objects. It ensures that steps are executed in the correct order and handles errors.

- **`PromptStep`**: Represents an individual step in the chain. Each step can have a `prompt_template` and can depend on the outputs of previous steps.

- **`ChainContext`**: Manages the state and results of the chain execution. It provides methods to add results, check for dependencies, and store metadata.

- **`StepConfig`**: Configuration for `PromptStep`, including timeout, retry count, retry delay, and whether the step is required.

- **`StepResult`**: Represents the result of a step, including the output, metadata, execution time, and any error.

### 4. Design Patterns Used

- **Builder Pattern**: Used in `builders.py` to create different chains with pre-defined configurations.

- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: Implemented in `PromptChain` to handle step dependencies and execution order.

- **Factory Method Pattern**: Implemented in `PromptChain` to create chains by type name.

- **Template Method Pattern**: Implemented in `PromptStep` to allow subclasses to provide specific implementations of methods.

- **Singleton Pattern**: Not explicitly used, but the module could be extended to include a singleton-like structure for managing global states if needed.

Overall, the module provides a flexible and extensible framework for creating and managing chains of prompts to generate detailed documentation from code snippets, using a combination of pre-defined chains and customizable steps.
