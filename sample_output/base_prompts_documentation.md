# Documentation: base_prompts.py

## Overview

This code defines a base class `BasePromptBuilder` for creating prompt templates in a structured manner, suitable for use in the DocGenAI application. The class includes shared formatting rules for Markdown documentation and a method to detect the programming language from a file extension. Subclasses can implement the `build_prompt` method to customize the prompt creation process.

## Key Components

- **BasePromptBuilder**: The main class that provides shared formatting rules and a method to detect programming language from file extensions.

- **MARKDOWN_FORMATTING_RULES**: A class attribute containing Markdown formatting rules applicable to all documentation.

- **COMMON_GUIDELINES**: A class attribute containing common guidelines for all prompts.

- **get_language_from_extension**: A static method that maps file extensions to their corresponding programming languages.

- **build_prompt**: A method that must be implemented by subclasses to build prompts with specific formatting rules.

## Architecture

The `BasePromptBuilder` class is designed to be a base class for creating prompt templates. It includes shared formatting rules and a method to detect the programming language from a file extension. Subclasses can utilize these shared resources to build prompts tailored to their specific needs.

## Usage Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `BasePromptBuilder` class to build a prompt:

```python
class MyPromptBuilder(BasePromptBuilder):
    def build_prompt(self, **kwargs) -> str:
        prompt = f"# {kwargs.get('title', 'Default Title')}\n\n"
        prompt += kwargs.get('content', 'No content provided.')
        return prompt

# Instantiate the subclass

builder = MyPromptBuilder()
prompt = builder.build_prompt(title="Sample Prompt", content="This is a sample prompt.")
print(prompt)

In this example, `MyPromptBuilder` is a subclass of `BasePromptBuilder` that overrides the `build_prompt` method to include a title and content in the prompt.

```

## Dependencies

This code does not depend on any external libraries or modules beyond standard Python libraries.

## Configuration

No configuration options or environment variables are required for this code to function.

## Error Handling

Errors are handled by raising `NotImplementedError` in the `build_prompt` method, which must be implemented by subclasses. This ensures that any attempt to use the `BasePromptBuilder` class directly will result in an error until a subclass is provided.

## Performance Considerations

The `get_language_from_extension` method is designed to be efficient and should handle a wide variety of file extensions quickly and reliably. The `build_prompt` method, being abstract, does not have a direct impact on performance but must be optimized by subclasses to meet the needs of their specific use case.

## Architecture Analysis

## Architectural Analysis

### 1. Architectural Patterns

The provided code does not explicitly use a known design pattern such as MVC (Model-View-Controller), Observer, Factory, or others. It is a straightforward implementation of a base class with static methods and a method that raises an error if not overridden by a subclass.
This structure is typical for a base class in an object-oriented design, where the methods are meant to be overridden by specific implementations for different use cases.

### 2. Code Organization

The code is organized into a single file, `base_prompts.py`, which contains a base class `BasePromptBuilder` with static attributes and methods. This organization is simple and directly reflects the responsibilities of the class, which is to provide shared functionality for building prompts with specific formatting rules.

### 3. Data Flow

The data flow in this code is straightforward. The `BasePromptBuilder` class has a static method `get_language_from_extension` that maps file extensions to programming languages. This method is used to detect the language of a file based on its extension.
The `build_prompt` method is abstract and must be overridden by subclasses, which indicates that data processing or transformation might occur in those subclasses.

### 4. Dependencies

The code has no external dependencies other than standard Python libraries. The `get_language_from_extension` method uses a dictionary to map file extensions to language identifiers. This internal dependency on a static dictionary for data lookup is straightforward and does not pose significant challenges in terms of dependencies.

### 5. Interfaces

The interfaces exposed by this code are limited to the `BasePromptBuilder` class, which includes:

- `MARKDOWN_FORMATTING_RULES`: A static attribute containing Markdown formatting rules.

- `COMMON_GUIDELINES`: Another static attribute with common guidelines for all prompts.

- `get_language_from_extension`: A static method to detect language from file extension.

- `build_prompt`: An abstract method that must be overridden by subclasses to build prompts.

### 6. Extensibility

The code is designed to be extensible. The `build_prompt` method is abstract and must be overridden by any subclass that needs to implement specific prompt-building logic. This design allows for future expansion without modifying the existing code, adhering to the open/closed principle of SOLID principles.

### 7. Design Principles

The code adheres to several design principles:

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The `BasePromptBuilder` class has only one responsibility, which is to provide shared formatting rules and methods for building prompts.

- **Open/Closed Principle**: The `BasePromptBuilder` class is open for extension (via overriding `build_prompt`) but closed for modification (the core logic does not change).

- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subclasses of `BasePromptBuilder` can be used interchangeably wherever an instance of `BasePromptBuilder` is expected, as long as they adhere to the contract defined by the base class.

- **Interface Segregation Principle**: The interface is not broken down into multiple segregated parts, but the methods defined in the base class are clear and specific to the task of building prompts.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: The `BasePromptBuilder` class does not depend on lower-level modules directly; instead, it depends on abstractions (like the `get_language_from_extension` method).

### 8. Potential Improvements

While the current implementation is straightforward and effective for its purpose, there are potential areas for improvement:

- **Documentation**: Adding more detailed comments or docstrings for the `get_language_from_extension` method and `build_prompt` method would help developers understand the logic and usage better.

- **Error Handling**: Adding error handling for unexpected inputs in `get_language_from_extension` and `build_prompt` methods could make the code more robust.

- **Subclassing**: Providing more detailed examples or a template for how to subclass `BasePromptBuilder` and implement `build_prompt` for specific use cases could be beneficial for users.

Overall, the code is well-structured and follows good software design principles, making it easy to extend and maintain.
