# Documentation: context.py

## Overview

The `ChainContext` class in the `src/docgenai/chaining/context.py` file is designed to manage the state and results of a sequence of prompt chains. It provides a structured way to store and retrieve the outputs and metadata from each step of the chain, making it easier to track the progress and outcomes of each individual step.
This is particularly useful in complex applications where multiple steps are involved in generating a final output.

## Key Components

- **StepResult**: A data class representing the result of a single chain step. It includes the step name, the output, metadata, execution time, an optional error message, and a timestamp.

- **ChainContext**: The main class that manages the context for the chain. It includes methods to set and retrieve inputs, add results, and manage metadata. It also provides properties to check the status of the chain, such as whether it is complete, the number of successful and failed steps, and the total execution time.

## Architecture

The `ChainContext` class is initialized with optional initial inputs and starts tracking the time when it is created. As each step of the chain completes, a `StepResult` object is added to the `results` dictionary, which maps step names to their results. The `ChainContext` class also allows setting and retrieving metadata about the chain execution.

## Usage Examples

Here's a practical example of how to use the `ChainContext` class:

```python

# Initialize ChainContext with some initial inputs

context = ChainContext({"prompt": "Tell me a story"})

# Define a step result

step_result = StepResult(step_name="generate_story", output="Once upon a time...")

# Add the step result to the context

context.add_result(step_result)

# Check if a step has completed successfully

if context.has_result("generate_story"):
    print("The story generation step has completed successfully.")

# Get the output of a specific step

story_output = context.get_output("generate_story")
print(f"Story output: {story_output}")

# Get all successful step outputs

successful_outputs = context.get_all_outputs()
print(f"Successful outputs: {successful_outputs}")

```

## Dependencies

The `ChainContext` class depends on the `time` module for tracking the execution time and the `dataclasses` module for creating `StepResult` objects.

## Configuration

No external configuration options are required for the `ChainContext` class. However, the `initial_inputs` parameter should be provided when initializing the context to allow for dynamic input handling.

## Error Handling

Errors are handled by setting the `error` attribute of a `StepResult` object when a step fails. The `ChainContext` class provides methods to check for and retrieve failed steps.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance, consider using more efficient data structures for storing results and inputs, especially if the number of steps becomes large. Additionally, ensure that the `metadata` dictionary does not grow too large, as this could impact performance.

## Summary

The `ChainContext` class provides a flexible and structured way to manage the state and results of a sequence of prompt chains. It simplifies the process of tracking the progress and outcomes of each individual step, making it easier to build complex applications that involve multiple steps in the chain.

## Architecture Analysis

## Architectural Analysis of `context.py`

### 1. Architectural Patterns

The code does not explicitly use a known design pattern like MVC, Observer, Factory, etc. It follows a simple object-oriented design with a `ChainContext` class that manages the state and results of a chain of prompts.

### 2. Code Organization

The code is organized into a single file with a clear structure:

- **Imports**: Standard library imports and custom classes/functions.

- **Data Classes**: `StepResult` is defined using `@dataclass`.

- **Main Class**: `ChainContext` contains methods to manage inputs, results, metadata, and execution status.

- **Properties**: Methods that return properties like execution time, completion status, etc.

- **Serialization**: A `to_dict` method for serializing the context.

### 3. Data Flow

- **Inputs**: Managed through `set_input` and `get_input` methods.

- **Results**: Stored in a dictionary where keys are step names and values are `StepResult` objects.

- **Metadata**: Set and retrieved using `set_metadata` and `get_metadata` methods.

- **Execution Status**: Tracked through `start_time`, `end_time`, and properties like `is_complete`.

### 4. Dependencies

- **Internal Dependencies**: Methods within `ChainContext` depend on each other and on the `StepResult` class.

- **External Dependencies**: Minimal, only `time` for timestamps and `dataclasses` for the `@dataclass` decorator.

### 5. Interfaces

- **Public Methods**:
  - `set_input`, `get_input`, `add_result`, `get_result`, `get_output`, `has_result`, `get_all_outputs`, `get_failed_steps`, `set_metadata`, `get_metadata`, `mark_complete`, `to_dict`

- **Properties**: `execution_time`, `is_complete`, `step_count`, `success_count`, `failure_count`

### 6. Extensibility

- **Adding New Features**: Adding new features would require creating new methods in `ChainContext` or modifying existing ones, adhering to the existing structure and interfaces.

- **Modifying Existing Features**: Modifying methods would need to follow the existing method signatures and maintain the same contract.

### 7. Design Principles

- **SOLID Principles**: The code follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) by having `ChainContext` manage chain state and results.

- **Separation of Concerns**: The class handles both data storage and query operations, keeping concerns separated.

### 8. Potential Improvements

- **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling within `StepResult` and `ChainContext` to provide more informative errors and handle edge cases better.

- **Logging**: Integrate logging to track the flow of execution and handle errors more effectively.

- **Testing**: Implement unit tests to cover different scenarios and ensure the stability of the code.

## Conclusion

The `ChainContext` class in `context.py` provides a clear and functional design for managing the state and results of a chain of prompts. While it does not use a specific design pattern, the structure is well-organized and follows basic object-oriented principles. For further enhancements, consider improving error handling, adding logging, and enhancing test coverage.
