# Documentation: builders.py

## Overview

This code provides a set of pre-built chain configurations for generating and enhancing documentation, as well as an architecture diagram. These chains are designed to help users generate detailed, well-structured documentation for their code, with an optional enhancement step and support for architecture diagrams in the future.
The `ChainBuilder` class offers methods to create and manage these chains, including a method to generate a custom chain based on user-defined steps.

## Key Components

- **PromptChain**: A sequence of `PromptStep` objects that define the steps of a chain.

- **PromptStep**: An individual step within a `PromptChain`, containing a prompt template, configuration, and metadata.

- **StepConfig**: Configuration settings for a `PromptStep`, including timeout settings.

- **metadata**: Additional data associated with each step, such as type and version information.

## Architecture

The `ChainBuilder` class provides static methods to create specific chains:

- **simple_documentation_chain()**: Creates a single-step chain for basic documentation generation.

- **enhanced_documentation_chain()**: Creates a multi-step chain that includes code analysis, detailed documentation generation, and review/enhancement.

- **architecture_diagram_chain()**: A planned feature for future implementation, which involves analyzing code architecture, generating textual descriptions, and creating diagram specifications.

- **custom_chain(steps, name, fail_fast)**: Allows users to define custom chains by passing a list of `PromptStep` objects, an optional name, and a fail-fast setting.

## Usage Examples

To use the `ChainBuilder` class, you would typically import it and call the appropriate method based on the type of chain you need. Here's a simple example:

```python
from docgenai.chaining.builders import ChainBuilder

# Create a simple documentation chain

chain = ChainBuilder.simple_documentation_chain()

For more complex configurations, you can use the `enhanced_documentation_chain()` method:

```

```python
from docgenai.chaining.builders import ChainBuilder

# Create an enhanced documentation chain

chain = ChainBuilder.enhanced_documentation_chain()

```

## Dependencies

This code relies on the following external modules:

- `typing` for type annotations.

- `PromptChain` and `PromptStep` from the same package for chain and step creation.

## Configuration

No specific configuration options are provided in the code. However, `StepConfig` allows users to set timeout settings for each step, which can be configured through the `ChainBuilder` methods.

## Error Handling

The `ChainBuilder` class raises a `ValueError` if an unknown chain type is requested:

```python
from docgenai.chaining.builders import ChainBuilder

try:
    chain = ChainBuilder.create_chain("unknown_type")
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)

```

## Performance Considerations

The performance of the chains is dependent on the complexity of the code and the efficiency of the prompts. For optimal performance, ensure that the prompts are concise and the code analysis is efficient.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to using the `ChainBuilder` class for creating and managing documentation chains, with a focus on flexibility and extensibility.

## Architecture Analysis

## Architectural Patterns

The code primarily uses the **Builder Pattern** to construct complex objects (`PromptChain`) in a step-by-step manner. This pattern is evident in the `ChainBuilder` class, where each method (`simple_documentation_chain`, `enhanced_documentation_chain`, `architecture_diagram_chain`, `custom_chain`) constructs a specific `PromptChain` by adding `PromptStep` objects to it.

## Code Organization

The code is organized into a class-based structure with static methods, each responsible for creating different types of `PromptChain` configurations. The `ChainBuilder` class contains:

- `simple_documentation_chain`: A single-step chain for simple documentation generation.

- `enhanced_documentation_chain`: A multi-step chain for enhanced documentation, including analysis, generation, and enhancement.

- `architecture_diagram_chain`: A chain for generating architecture documentation with diagrams, planned for future implementation.

- `custom_chain`: A method to create custom chains by providing a list of `PromptStep` objects.

- `get_available_chains`: A utility method to list available pre-built chains.

- `create_chain`: A class method to create chains by specifying the type and additional arguments.

## Data Flow

Data flows through the system primarily through the `PromptStep` objects, which are instantiated with templates, configurations, and dependencies. The `PromptChain` is constructed by adding these `PromptStep` objects to it. Data flows from the `PromptStep` objects to the `PromptChain` for processing and output generation.

## Dependencies (2)

- **Internal Dependencies**: The `ChainBuilder` class depends on `PromptChain` and `PromptStep` classes for its functionality.

- **External Dependencies**: The code does not depend on external libraries or modules beyond standard Python libraries (`typing`).

## Interfaces

Public interfaces exposed by the `ChainBuilder` class include:

- `simple_documentation_chain`: Creates a simple single-step chain for documentation generation.

- `enhanced_documentation_chain`: Creates a multi-step chain for enhanced documentation.

- `architecture_diagram_chain`: Creates a chain for generating architecture documentation with diagrams.

- `custom_chain`: Allows creating custom chains by providing a list of `PromptStep` objects.

- `get_available_chains`: Lists available pre-built chains.

- `create_chain`: Creates chains by specifying the type and additional arguments.

## Extensibility

The code is highly extensible. The `ChainBuilder` class provides methods to create different types of chains (`simple`, `enhanced`, `architecture`, `custom`) by configuring `PromptStep` objects. Additionally, the `create_chain` method allows creating custom chains by specifying the type and additional arguments.

## Design Principles

- **SOLID Principles**: The code adheres to SOLID principles, particularly the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by encapsulating chain creation logic within the `ChainBuilder` class.

- **Separation of Concerns**: The code separates concerns by placing each type of chain creation logic in dedicated methods, making the system modular and easier to maintain.

## Potential Improvements

- **Dynamic Configuration**: Consider allowing dynamic configuration of `PromptStep` objects at runtime to enhance flexibility.

- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling to provide more informative errors when chain types are unknown or invalid.

- **Documentation**: Enhance documentation to include more detailed explanations of each method and its usage.

Overall, the `ChainBuilder` class is well-structured and follows good software design principles, making it easy to extend and maintain.
