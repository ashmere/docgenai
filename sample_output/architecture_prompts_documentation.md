# Documentation: architecture_prompts.py

## Overview

This code defines a `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` class within the `docgenai` module, which is responsible for building architecture analysis prompts based on the provided source code and file path. The class inherits from `BasePromptBuilder` and includes a `build_prompt` method that constructs a detailed architectural analysis prompt tailored to the programming language of the provided code.
The method supports optional language specification, with auto-detection based on the file extension if not provided.

## Key Components

- **ArchitecturePromptBuilder**: The main class responsible for constructing architecture analysis prompts.

- **build_prompt**: A method that generates a detailed architectural analysis prompt based on the provided source code and file path.

- **get_language_from_extension**: A helper method to determine the programming language from the file extension if not explicitly provided.

## Architecture

The `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` class operates by first detecting the programming language from the file extension if not specified, then constructing a detailed architectural analysis prompt by analyzing the provided source code.
The analysis focuses on aspects such as architectural patterns, code organization, data flow, dependencies, interfaces, extensibility, design principles, and potential improvements.

## Usage Examples

To use the `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` class, you would typically create an instance of it and call the `build_prompt` method with the appropriate arguments. Here's a simple example:

```python
from docgenai.prompts import ArchitecturePromptBuilder

# Create an instance of ArchitecturePromptBuilder

builder = ArchitecturePromptBuilder()

# Path to the source code file

file_path = 'path/to/your/code.py'

# Read the source code from the file

with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    code = file.read()

# Build the architecture analysis prompt

prompt = builder.build_prompt(code, file_path)
print(prompt)

This example demonstrates how to instantiate the `ArchitecturePromptBuilder`, read the source code from a file, and generate an architecture analysis prompt.

```

## Dependencies

- **pathlib**: Used for file path manipulation.

- **BasePromptBuilder**: Inherits from this base class to leverage its functionality.

## Configuration

- **Language Auto-Detection**: The `get_language_from_extension` method automatically detects the programming language based on the file extension.

- **Prompt Customization**: The `build_prompt` method supports customization of the prompt through additional keyword arguments if needed.

## Error Handling

- The `build_prompt` method raises a `ValueError` if the provided `file_path` does not exist or if the `code` is not a valid string.

- Error details are logged, and user-friendly messages are provided to guide the user in resolving the issue.

## Performance Considerations

- The performance of the `build_prompt` method is dependent on the size of the provided code and the efficiency of the language detection mechanism.

- For large codebases, consider optimizing the language detection mechanism or using pre-defined language profiles to speed up the process.

## Architecture Analysis

## Architectural Patterns

The code does not explicitly use any known design patterns such as MVC, Observer, or Factory. It appears to be a simple class-based structure with a builder pattern for creating prompts.

## Code Organization

The code is organized into a single file `architecture_prompts.py` within the `src/docgenai/prompts` directory. The file contains a single class `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` which is responsible for building architecture analysis prompts.

## Data Flow

The data flow in this code is straightforward. The `build_prompt` method takes a code string, a file path, and optional language arguments, and returns a formatted string containing the architectural analysis.

## Dependencies (2)

- **Internal Dependencies**: The `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` class depends on the `BasePromptBuilder` class from the same module.

- **External Dependencies**: The code does not depend on any external libraries or frameworks.

## Interfaces

The public interface exposed by this code is the `build_prompt` method of the `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` class.

## Extensibility

The code is designed to be easily extensible. Adding new features or modifying the existing ones would typically involve adding new methods or modifying the existing ones in the `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` class.

## Design Principles

- **SOLID Principles**: The code adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle by having a single class responsible for building architecture analysis prompts.

- **Separation of Concerns**: The responsibilities are well-separated, with the `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` class handling only the prompt building logic.

## Potential Improvements

1. **Design Patterns**: Consider incorporating a design pattern to enhance the flexibility and maintainability of the code.

2. **Code Comments**: Adding comments to explain complex parts of the code would improve readability and maintainability.

3. **Error Handling**: Implementing error handling for potential issues in the code, such as invalid inputs, would make the system more robust.

This analysis provides a detailed overview of the code's architecture, focusing on the aspects that contribute to its design and functionality.
