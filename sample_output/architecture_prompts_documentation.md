# Documentation: architecture_prompts.py

## Overview

This code provides a system for generating detailed architectural analysis prompts from source code. It is designed to help software architects and developers understand the structure and design of the code by analyzing various aspects such as architectural patterns, code organization, data flow, dependencies, interfaces, extensibility, design principles, and potential improvements.

## Key Components

- **ArchitecturePromptBuilder**: Main class responsible for building architecture analysis prompts.

- **build_prompt**: Function that constructs the prompt based on the provided source code and file path.

## Architecture

The `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` class uses the `BasePromptBuilder` as a base class, inheriting methods and properties for building prompts. The `build_prompt` function takes the source code, file path, and optionally the programming language, and constructs a detailed architectural analysis prompt using the provided information.

## Usage Examples

To use the `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` class, you would typically initialize it with a base prompt builder and then call the `build_prompt` method with the code and file path of the source file you wish to analyze. Here's a simple example:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from docgenai.prompts import ArchitecturePromptBuilder

# Initialize the builder

builder = ArchitecturePromptBuilder()

# Path to the source code file

file_path = "path/to/your/code.py"

# Read the source code from the file

with open(file_path, "r") as file:
    code = file.read()

# Build the prompt

prompt = builder.build_prompt(code, file_path)
print(prompt)

```

## Dependencies

- **pathlib**: Standard library for file system path manipulation.

- **BasePromptBuilder**: Custom module for building base prompts, assumed to be defined elsewhere in the project.

## Configuration

- **language**: Optional parameter for specifying the programming language of the source code. If not provided, it will be auto-detected from the file extension.

## Error Handling

- The `build_prompt` function raises a `ValueError` if the provided `file_path` does not exist or if the `code` is not a valid string.

## Performance Considerations

- The performance of this system is dependent on the size of the code and the efficiency of the `get_language_from_extension` method. For large codebases, optimizing this method or using a cached result could improve performance.

## Architecture Analysis

## Architectural Patterns

The code does not explicitly use any known design patterns such as MVC, Observer, or Factory. It appears to be a simple class-based structure with a builder pattern for creating prompts.

## Code Organization

The code is organized into a single file, `architecture_prompts.py`, which contains the `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` class and its methods. The class inherits from `BasePromptBuilder`, indicating a potential for modularity and reuse of functionality.

## Data Flow

The data flow in this code is straightforward. The `build_prompt` method takes `code`, `file_path`, and `language` as arguments, processes them, and returns a formatted string containing the architectural analysis.

## Dependencies (2)

- **Internal Dependencies**: The `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` class depends on the `BasePromptBuilder` class for its base functionality.

- **External Dependencies**: The code does not depend on any external libraries or frameworks.

## Interfaces

The public interface exposed by the `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` class includes the `build_prompt` method, which is the primary way to interact with the class for generating architectural analysis prompts.

## Extensibility

The code is designed to be extensible. The `build_prompt` method is flexible and can be extended to include more detailed analysis or additional features in future versions.

## Design Principles

- **SOLID Principles**: The code adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle by having a single responsibility (building architecture analysis prompts).

- **Separation of Concerns**: The concerns of code organization, prompt building, and language detection are separated into distinct components.

## Potential Improvements

1. **Design Patterns**: Consider incorporating design patterns to enhance the structure and functionality of the code.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage potential issues with input code or file paths.

3. **Language Detection**: Improve language detection mechanism to handle more programming languages accurately.

This analysis provides a clear understanding of the code's structure and functionality, highlighting both its strengths and areas for potential improvement.
