# Documentation: prompt_manager.py

## Overview

This code provides a `PromptManager` class that coordinates different prompt builders for generating documentation and architecture analysis prompts. It includes `build_documentation_prompt` and `build_architecture_prompt` methods to generate prompts based on the provided source code and file path.
Additionally, it includes a `detect_language` method to determine the programming language of the source file.

## Key Components

- **PromptManager**: The main class that manages the prompt builders.

- **DocumentationPromptBuilder**: A builder for generating documentation prompts.

- **ArchitecturePromptBuilder**: A builder for generating architecture analysis prompts.

## Architecture

The `PromptManager` class initializes two prompt builders, `DocumentationPromptBuilder` and `ArchitecturePromptBuilder`. These builders are responsible for constructing prompts for documentation and architecture analysis, respectively. The `PromptManager` class provides methods to build these prompts using the provided source code and file path, along with additional parameters.

## Usage Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `PromptManager` class to build a documentation prompt:

```python
from src.docgenai.prompts.prompt_manager import PromptManager

# Initialize the PromptManager

manager = PromptManager()

# Define the source code and file path

code = """
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Return a greeting string."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
"""
file_path = "path/to/your/file.py"

# Build the documentation prompt

prompt = manager.build_documentation_prompt(code, file_path)
print(prompt)

This will generate a documentation prompt based on the provided source code and file path.

```

## Dependencies

- `pathlib`: Standard library for file path operations.

- `ArchitecturePromptBuilder`: A custom module for building architecture analysis prompts.

- `DocumentationPromptBuilder`: A custom module for building documentation prompts.

## Configuration

No configuration options are provided in this code. However, you can extend the `PromptManager` class to include configuration settings if needed.

## Error Handling

Errors are handled using standard Python exception handling mechanisms. Common issues include incorrect file paths or invalid source code. The `detect_language` method raises a `FileNotFoundError` if the provided file path does not exist.

## Performance Considerations

The performance of the `PromptManager` class is dependent on the efficiency of the underlying prompt builders. Ensure that the `DocumentationPromptBuilder` and `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` are optimized for performance to handle large codebases effectively.

```python

```python

```

## Architecture Analysis

## Architectural Patterns

The code does not explicitly use a known design pattern such as MVC, Observer, Factory, etc. However, it does implement a simple form of dependency injection by creating instances of `DocumentationPromptBuilder` and `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` within the `PromptManager` class.

## Code Organization

The code is organized into several parts:

- A `PromptManager` class that acts as a manager for coordinating different prompt builders.

- Two prompt builder classes, `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` and `DocumentationPromptBuilder`, which are used by the `PromptManager` to build prompts.

- A `detect_language` method to detect the programming language from the file path.

## Data Flow

The data flow in this code is primarily through the `PromptManager` class, where it interacts with the `DocumentationPromptBuilder` and `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` classes to build prompts. The `build_documentation_prompt` and `build_architecture_prompt` methods take `code` and `file_path` as inputs and return the constructed prompts.

## Dependencies (2)

- **Internal Dependencies**: The `PromptManager` class depends on `DocumentationPromptBuilder` and `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` for its functionality.

- **External Dependencies**: The code does not depend on external libraries or frameworks.

## Interfaces

The public interfaces exposed by the `PromptManager` class are:

- `build_documentation_prompt`: Builds a documentation generation prompt.

- `build_architecture_prompt`: Builds an architecture analysis prompt.

- `detect_language`: Detects the programming language from the file path.

## Extensibility

The code is designed to be extensible. For example, if new prompt builders are added, they can be easily integrated into the `PromptManager` by modifying the `**init**` method to include them. Additionally, new methods can be added to the `PromptManager` class to handle additional functionalities.

## Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: The `PromptManager` class handles the management of different prompt builders, while the prompt builders themselves handle the construction of prompts.

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a single responsibility, which helps in maintaining the code's simplicity and making it easier to test and modify.

## Potential Improvements

1. **Use of Design Patterns**: Consider using a Factory pattern to create instances of prompt builders, which can make the code more flexible and easier to extend.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage potential errors that might occur during the operation of the `PromptManager`.

3. **Unit Testing**: Adding unit tests to ensure that each component of the `PromptManager` works as expected, especially the interaction between `PromptManager`, `DocumentationPromptBuilder`, and `ArchitecturePromptBuilder`.

This analysis provides a clear understanding of the code's structure, its dependencies, and potential areas for improvement.
