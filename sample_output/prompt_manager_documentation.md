# Documentation: prompt_manager.py

## Overview

This code provides a `PromptManager` class that coordinates the generation of prompts for both architectural analysis and documentation from source code. It uses two prompt builders, `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` and `DocumentationPromptBuilder`, to construct prompts tailored to the specific needs of each type of documentation.
The manager also includes a method to detect the programming language from a given file path.

## Key Components

- **PromptManager**: The main class that initializes and coordinates the two prompt builders.

- **DocumentationPromptBuilder**: A builder responsible for creating prompts for generating documentation from source code.

- **ArchitecturePromptBuilder**: A builder responsible for creating prompts for analyzing the architecture of the source code.

## Architecture

The `PromptManager` class acts as an intermediary between the source code and the prompt builders. It initializes instances of `DocumentationPromptBuilder` and `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` in its constructor. The `build_documentation_prompt` method uses the `DocumentationPromptBuilder` to generate a prompt based on the provided source code and file path.
Similarly, the `build_architecture_prompt` method uses the `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` to generate a prompt for architecture analysis. The `detect_language` method determines the programming language of the source code by examining the file path and delegates the language detection to the `DocumentationPromptBuilder`.

## Usage Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `PromptManager` to build a documentation prompt:

```python
prompt_manager = PromptManager()
code = open('path/to/your/code.py').read()
file_path = 'path/to/your/code.py'
prompt = prompt_manager.build_documentation_prompt(code, file_path)
print(prompt)

And here's an example of how to use the `PromptManager` to build an architecture prompt:

```

```python
prompt_manager = PromptManager()
code = open('path/to/your/code.py').read()
file_path = 'path/to/your/code.py'
prompt = prompt_manager.build_architecture_prompt(code, file_path)
print(prompt)

```

## Dependencies

- `pathlib`: Standard library for file path manipulation.

- `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` and `DocumentationPromptBuilder` from the same module.

## Configuration

No specific configuration options are provided in the code. The `PromptManager` class does not require any environment variables or configuration files.

## Error Handling

Errors are handled within the `PromptManager` class by raising exceptions from the `DocumentationPromptBuilder` and `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` classes when appropriate. Common issues include invalid file paths or unsupported file types.

## Performance Considerations

The `PromptManager` class aims to be efficient by minimizing the number of external API calls and optimizing the internal processing of the source code. However, the performance can vary depending on the size and complexity of the source code being processed.

## Architecture Analysis

## Architectural Patterns

The code does not explicitly use a known design pattern such as MVC, Observer, Factory, etc. It is a simple class-based structure with a single instance (`PromptManager`) managing two different prompt builders (`DocumentationPromptBuilder` and `ArchitecturePromptBuilder`).

## Code Organization

The code is organized into a single file `prompt_manager.py`. It contains a class `PromptManager` with methods for building prompts and detecting the programming language. The class initializes two prompt builders (`DocumentationPromptBuilder` and `ArchitecturePromptBuilder`) which are used to build prompts for documentation and architecture analysis, respectively.

## Data Flow

- **Initialization**: The `PromptManager` class is initialized with two prompt builders (`DocumentationPromptBuilder` and `ArchitecturePromptBuilder`).

- **Prompt Building**: The `build_documentation_prompt` and `build_architecture_prompt` methods use the respective prompt builders to generate prompts based on the provided source code and file path.

- **Language Detection**: The `detect_language` method uses the `DocumentationPromptBuilder`'s `get_language_from_extension` method to detect the programming language from the file path.

## Dependencies (2)

- **Internal Dependencies**: The `PromptManager` class depends on `DocumentationPromptBuilder` and `ArchitecturePromptBuilder` for its functionality.

- **External Dependencies**: The code uses the `pathlib` module for file path operations, which is part of the Python standard library.

## Interfaces

- **Public Methods**:
  - `build_documentation_prompt`: Builds a documentation generation prompt.
  - `build_architecture_prompt`: Builds an architecture analysis prompt.
  - `detect_language`: Detects the programming language from the file path.

## Extensibility

The current implementation is straightforward and easy to extend. To add more prompt builders, one would simply create a new builder class and modify the `PromptManager` to include it. The `PromptManager` class does not hardcode any specific builder, making it flexible to new types of prompts.

## Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: The `PromptManager` class handles the management of different prompt builders, while each builder is responsible for building specific types of prompts.

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each method in `PromptManager` has a single responsibility, managing prompts or detecting language.

## Potential Improvements

1. **Use of Design Patterns**: Consider using the Factory pattern to create instances of prompt builders, which could improve the instantiation process and make the code more maintainable.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage potential issues with file paths or inputs.

3. **Configuration**: Introduce a configuration mechanism to manage parameters for prompt building, making the system more adaptable to different environments.

By following these suggestions, the code could become more robust and adaptable to future changes and requirements.
