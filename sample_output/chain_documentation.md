# Documentation: chain.py

## Overview

The `PromptChain` class in the `src/docgenai/chaining/chain.py` file is designed to orchestrate the execution of a sequence of `PromptStep` objects, each representing a specific step in an AI generation process. The chain can handle dependencies between steps, manage parallel execution, and includes error handling and retry logic.
It also provides a mechanism to retrieve and manipulate individual steps within the chain.

## Key Components

- **PromptChain Class**: Orchestrates execution of multiple prompt steps in sequence.
  - **`**init**` Method**: Initializes the chain with a list of `PromptStep` objects, a name, a failure behavior setting, and a maximum parallel execution limit.
  - **`_validate_chain` Method**: Validates the chain configuration by checking for duplicate step names and invalid dependencies.
  - **`_check_circular_dependencies` Method**: Checks for circular dependencies in the chain.
  - **`_get_execution_order` Method**: Determines the execution order based on dependencies.
  - **`execute` Method**: Executes the chain by calling the provided `model_fn` with prompts from each step.
  - **`get_step` Method**: Retrieves a step by name.
  - **`add_step` Method**: Adds a new step to the chain.
  - **`remove_step` Method**: Removes a step from the chain by name.
  - **`step_names` Property**: Returns a list of all step names.
  - **`**repr**` Method**: Provides a string representation of the chain.

## Architecture

The `PromptChain` class works by:

1. Validating the chain configuration to ensure there are no duplicate step names and that all dependencies are valid.

2. Determining the execution order based on dependencies.

3. Executing each step in the determined order, capturing results and errors.

4. Handling errors by stopping execution if `fail_fast` is enabled.

5. Logging the execution process and results.

## Usage Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `PromptChain` class:

```python
from src.docgenai.chaining.chain import PromptChain
from src.docgenai.chaining.step import PromptStep

# Define some prompt steps

step1 = PromptStep(name="Step 1", prompt="First step", depends_on=[])
step2 = PromptStep(name="Step 2", prompt="Second step", depends_on=["Step 1"])

# Create a chain with the steps

chain = PromptChain(steps=[step1, step2])

# Define a mock model function for demonstration

def mock_model_fn(prompt: str) -> str:
    return f"Response to: {prompt}"

# Execute the chain

result = chain.execute(model_fn=mock_model_fn, initial_inputs={"initial_input": "initial value"})

# Print the results

print(result)

```

## Dependencies

- The `PromptChain` class depends on the `PromptStep` class and utilizes the `ChainContext` class for managing context during execution.

## Configuration

- The `PromptChain` class can be configured with a `name`, `fail_fast` setting, and `max_parallel` setting.

- The `fail_fast` setting determines whether the chain stops execution on encountering an error.

- The `max_parallel` setting, while currently not functional, is intended for future use to limit the number of parallel steps.

## Error Handling

- The `PromptChain` class handles errors by stopping execution if `fail_fast` is enabled and by logging errors and results.

- Common issues include invalid step names in dependencies and circular dependencies.

## Performance Considerations

- The `PromptChain` class aims to optimize performance by executing steps in the order determined by their dependencies.

- Future enhancements may include parallel execution to improve performance, though this feature is not yet implemented.

## Architecture Analysis

## Architectural Analysis of `chain.py`

### 1. Architectural Patterns

The code primarily follows a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern, although it's not explicitly named as such. The `PromptChain` class acts as the controller, managing the execution of `PromptStep` objects, which are the models, and potentially the views could be added in the future for visualization or reporting purposes.

### 2. Code Organization

The code is well-organized into several components:

- **PromptChain Class**: Orchestrates the execution of multiple `PromptStep` objects.

- **PromptStep Class**: Represents a single step in the chain, encapsulating the logic for executing a prompt.

- **ChainContext**: Manages the context of the chain, including results and metadata.

- **Validation Methods**: `_validate_chain` and `_check_circular_dependencies` ensure the chain's integrity.

- **Execution Methods**: `_get_execution_order` and `execute` handle the execution logic.

### 3. Data Flow

- **Initialization**: The chain is initialized with a list of `PromptStep` objects.

- **Validation**: The chain validates the configuration to ensure no duplicate step names and valid dependencies.

- **Execution Order**: The chain determines the execution order based on dependencies.

- **Execution**: Steps are executed in the determined order, and results are managed via `ChainContext`.

### 4. Dependencies

- **Internal Dependencies**: The `PromptChain` and `PromptStep` classes have dependencies on each other.

- **External Dependencies**: The chain uses `ChainContext` and `logging` for external interactions.

### 5. Interfaces

- **Public Methods**: `execute`, `add_step`, `remove_step`, `get_step` are public interfaces provided by `PromptChain`.

- **Internal Methods**: Methods like `_validate_chain`, `_get_execution_order` are internal and used for chain management.

### 6. Extensibility

- **Adding/Removing Steps**: The `add_step` and `remove_step` methods allow for dynamic modification of the chain.

- **Configuration Flexibility**: The chain can be configured with different `PromptStep` objects, providing flexibility in how the chain operates.

### 7. Design Principles

- **SOLID Principles**: The code adheres to several SOLID principles:
  - **Single Responsibility Principle**: The `PromptChain` class handles chain orchestration.
  - **Open/Closed Principle**: The `PromptChain` is open for extension (via `add_step`) but closed for modification (the main logic is not modified).
  - **Liskov Substitution Principle**: The `PromptChain` and `PromptStep` classes are designed to be interchangeable in some contexts.
  - **Interface Segregation Principle**: The `PromptChain` interacts with `PromptStep` and `ChainContext` via well-defined interfaces.
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules like `PromptChain` depend on abstractions (like `PromptStep` and `ChainContext`), not concrete implementations.

- **Separation of Concerns**: The code separates concerns such as chain management, step execution, and context management.

### 8. Potential Improvements

- **Parallel Execution**: The current implementation only allows for sequential execution. Future enhancements could include parallel execution based on the `max_parallel` setting.

- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling to provide more detailed feedback and allow for more sophisticated retry logic.

- **Logging**: Enhance logging to include more detailed information about each step's execution.

- **Configuration**: Allow for more flexible configuration options, such as different execution strategies based on step dependencies.

Overall, the code is well-structured and follows good software design principles, making it extensible and maintainable.
