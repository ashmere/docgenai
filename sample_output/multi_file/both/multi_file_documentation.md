### System Purpose & Architecture

The `PromptChain` system is designed to facilitate the orchestration of multi-step AI generation tasks, allowing for complex workflows that involve multiple prompts and dependencies between steps. The system is built around the concept of a `PromptChain` class, which manages the execution of individual `PromptStep` objects in a sequence.

#### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Modular Design**: The system is composed of discrete `PromptStep` objects, each responsible for a specific part of the overall task. These steps can depend on the outputs of other steps, creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of execution.

2. **ChainContext**: The `ChainContext` class serves as a central repository for the state and results of the chain execution. It allows for the sharing of data between steps and provides a mechanism to track the progress and outcomes of each step.

3. **Error Handling and Retry Logic**: The system includes built-in mechanisms for error handling and retry logic, which can be configured on a per-step basis. This ensures that if a step fails, the system can attempt to recover by retrying the step or moving to the next step in the sequence.

4. **Execution Monitoring**: The system logs the execution of each step, providing detailed information about the progress and outcomes of the chain. This logging can be customized and extended to meet specific needs.

#### Core Abstractions

- **PromptStep**: Represents a single step in the chain, encapsulating a prompt template and any dependencies on other steps.
- **ChainContext**: Manages the state and results of the chain execution, providing a centralized store for data and metadata.
- **PromptChain**: Orchestrates the execution of multiple `PromptStep` objects, managing dependencies and execution flow.

### Module Interaction Analysis

The `PromptChain` system is designed to interact with other modules in a modular way, allowing for easy integration and extension. The system's core components are:

- **`src/docgenai/chaining/chain.py`**: Defines the `PromptChain` class and its core functionalities.
- **`src/docgenai/chaining/step.py`**: Contains the `PromptStep` class, which defines individual steps in the chain.
- **`src/docgenai/chaining/context.py`**: Implements the `ChainContext` class, which manages the context for the chain execution.
- **`src/docgenai/chaining/**init**.py`**: Acts as an entry point for the chaining module, exporting the core components.

### Key Class Relationships

- **`PromptChain`**: Manages the execution of multiple `PromptStep` objects, ensuring that steps are executed in the correct order and that dependencies are respected.
- **`PromptStep`**: Represents a single step in the chain, encapsulating a prompt template and any dependencies on other steps.
- **`ChainContext`**: Manages the state and results of the chain execution, providing a centralized store for data and metadata.

### Development Guide

#### Extension Points

Developers can extend the system by creating new `PromptStep` implementations or by subclassing existing ones to customize behavior. The system provides hooks for customizing the execution of prompts and for adding custom logic to handle specific use cases.

#### Architecture Constraints

- The system assumes that the `model_fn` provided to `PromptChain.execute` is a callable that takes a string (the prompt) and returns a string (the model's response).
- The system expects that `PromptStep` objects are initialized with valid configurations, including valid `prompt_template` strings and appropriate `depends_on` lists.
- The system does not handle exceptions raised by `model_fn` itself; these should be caught and handled within the `PromptStep.execute` method.

## User Documentation

### Quick Start

To get started with the `PromptChain` system, follow these steps:

1. Install the package using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install docgenai
   ```

2. Import the necessary components from the package:

   ```python
   from docgenai.chaining.chain import PromptChain
   from docgenai.chaining.step import PromptStep
   ```

3. Create a new `PromptChain` instance and add `PromptStep` objects to it:

   ```python
   chain = PromptChain(steps=[PromptStep(...), PromptStep(...)])
   ```

4. Execute the chain using a model function:

   ```python
   context = chain.execute(model_fn=your_model_function)
   ```

### Command Line Interface

The `PromptChain` system provides a command line interface for executing chains and managing steps. Use the following commands to interact with the system:

- `chain execute`: Execute a chain with the given configuration.
- `step add`: Add a new step to the chain.
- `step remove`: Remove a step from the chain.

### Configuration Guide

The `PromptChain` system supports various configuration options, including:

- `fail_fast`: Stop execution on first failure (default: `True`).
- `max_parallel`: Maximum number of parallel steps (future feature, default: `1`).
- `timeout`: Timeout for each step (default: `300` seconds).
- `retry_count`: Number of retries for each step (default: `0`).
- `retry_delay`: Delay between retries (default: `1` second).

### Operational Guide

If you encounter issues with the `PromptChain` system, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Ensure that the `prompt_template` strings for each step are correctly formatted and include all necessary variables.
- Verify that the `depends_on` lists for each step are correct and that all dependencies are satisfied before execution.
- Check the logs for detailed information about the execution and any errors that occurred.
- Adjust the configuration options, such as `timeout`, `retry_count`, and `retry_delay`, to better suit your use case.
