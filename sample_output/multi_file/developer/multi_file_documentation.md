## System Purpose & Architecture

The `PromptChain` system is designed to facilitate the orchestration of multi-step AI generation processes. It enables users to define a sequence of prompts, each dependent on the outputs of previous prompts, to generate complex and structured documentation. This system is particularly useful in scenarios where detailed, multi-part documentation is required, such as in technical writing,
  legal contracts, or complex reports.

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Modular Design**: The system is broken down into several modules, each serving a specific purpose. This modular design allows for easier maintenance, scalability, and flexibility.

2. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: The `PromptChain` class uses the chain of responsibility pattern to handle requests (in this case, the execution of prompts) by passing them along a chain of handlers until they are handled. This pattern is particularly useful for handling requests where multiple objects may be able to handle them, but the specific handler is not known until runtime.

3. **Context Management**: The `ChainContext` class manages the state and results of the chain execution. This includes storing inputs, outputs, and metadata for each step, as well as handling the overall execution lifecycle.

4. **Error Handling and Retry Logic**: The system includes built-in error handling and retry logic, which can be configured per step. This ensures that if a step fails, the system can attempt to retry the step, providing robustness against transient errors.

5. **Asynchronous Execution**: While not implemented in the provided code, the system could be extended to support asynchronous execution of steps, allowing for more efficient use of system resources and potentially faster overall execution times.

### Overall System Design

The system operates on a microservices architecture, where each service is responsible for a specific part of the overall process. This design decision allows for each part of the process to be developed, tested, and deployed independently, which is particularly beneficial for complex, multi-step processes like AI-driven documentation generation.

## Module Interaction Analysis

### Dependencies and Interfaces

- **`chain.py`**: This module contains the core logic for the `PromptChain` class and its interactions with other modules. It defines the chain orchestration logic, step execution, and error handling.

- **`**init**.py`**: This module serves as a container for the package's contents and helps Python recognize it as a module. It also exports the core classes and functions from `chain.py` and `step.py`.

- **`step.py`**: This module defines the `PromptStep` class, which represents an individual step in the chain. Each step has a prompt template, dependencies on other steps, and a transformation function.

- **`context.py`**: This module contains the `ChainContext` and `StepResult` classes, which manage the context and results of the chain execution. These classes are crucial for maintaining the state and passing data between steps.

### Data Flow and Service Boundaries

- **Input/Output Management**: The `ChainContext` class is responsible for managing inputs and outputs for each step. Steps can access the outputs of other steps through this context, which is passed between steps during execution.

- **Error Propagation**: Errors encountered during step execution are captured in `StepResult` objects and stored in the `ChainContext`. This allows the system to track failures and handle them according to the configured logic.

- **Execution Flow**: The `PromptChain` class orchestrates the execution of steps in a sequence defined by dependencies. Each step is executed in turn, and the context is updated with the results of each step.

## Key Class Relationships

### Core Abstractions

- **`PromptChain`**: Orchestrates the execution of multiple `PromptStep` objects. Manages dependencies between steps and provides error handling and retry logic.

- **`PromptStep`**: Represents an individual step in the chain. Each step has a prompt template, dependencies on other steps, and a transformation function.

- **`ChainContext`**: Manages the state and results of the chain execution. Stores inputs, outputs, and metadata for each step, as well as the overall execution lifecycle.

- **`StepResult`**: Captures the result of a single step execution, including the output, metadata, and any errors encountered.

### Design Patterns

- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: Used in `PromptChain` to handle requests (step execution) by passing them along a chain of handlers until they are handled.

- **Microservices Architecture**: The system is designed with clear service boundaries, where each module is responsible for a specific part of the overall process. This modular design allows for easier maintenance, scalability, and flexibility.

## Microservices Architecture Insights

### Service Boundary Identification

- **`chain.py`**: Orchestrates the execution of steps and manages the overall chain execution lifecycle.

- **`step.py`**: Defines individual steps and their interactions with the chain context.

- **`context.py`**: Manages the state and results of the chain execution, including inputs, outputs, and metadata.

### Communication Patterns

- Steps in the chain communicate with each other through the `ChainContext`, which is passed between steps during execution. This allows for the sharing of data and state between steps.

- The `PromptChain` class acts as a coordinator, managing the sequence of step execution and handling errors and retries as configured.

## Development Guide

### Extension Points

- Developers can extend the system by adding new `PromptStep` implementations, each with its own prompt template, dependencies, and transformation function.

- The `PromptChain` class can be configured to handle new types of errors and retries by overriding default behaviors.

### Key Patterns to Follow

- **Dependency Injection**: The `PromptChain` and `PromptStep` classes use dependency injection to manage external dependencies and configurations.

- **State Management**: The `ChainContext` class is responsible for maintaining the state of the chain execution, ensuring that data is shared and updated correctly between steps.

### Architecture Constraints

- The system assumes that the AI model function (`model_fn`) is provided externally and can be called with a prompt string.

- The system is designed to handle synchronous execution of steps. Asynchronous execution can be added by extending the `PromptChain` class to support asynchronous task execution frameworks.

By following these guidelines and patterns, developers can extend and customize the `PromptChain` system to meet the needs of various AI-driven documentation generation scenarios.
