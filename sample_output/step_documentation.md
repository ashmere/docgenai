# Documentation: step.py

## Overview

This code defines a `PromptStep` class, which represents an individual step in a chain of prompts. Each step can have a prompt template, dependencies on other steps, a transformation function, and configuration options. The `PromptStep` class provides methods to check dependencies, build prompts, execute the step, and handle errors.

## Key Components

- **`StepConfig`**: A dataclass that holds configuration options for a prompt step, including timeout, retry count, retry delay, required status, and skip on failure status.

- **`PromptStep`**: The main class representing a prompt step in a chain. It includes methods to check if the step can be executed, build the prompt, execute the step, and handle errors.

## Architecture

The `PromptStep` class interacts with the `ChainContext` to gather inputs and outputs from other steps. It uses a `prompt_template` to generate prompts and optionally applies a `transform_fn` to the AI output. The `PromptStep` class also handles retries and errors according to the `StepConfig`.

## Usage Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `PromptStep` class:

```python

# Define a simple transformation function

def simple_transform(output: str, context: ChainContext) -> str:
    return output.upper()

# Create a chain context with initial inputs

context = ChainContext(inputs={"user_input": "Hello, world!"})

# Create a PromptStep with a template and a transform function

step = PromptStep(
    name="step1",
    prompt_template="Hello, {user_input}!",
    transform_fn=simple_transform
)

# Define a mock model function for demonstration

def mock_model_fn(prompt: str) -> str:
    return "Hello, AI!"

# Execute the step

result = step.execute(context, mock_model_fn)
print(result)

```

## Dependencies

- **`ChainContext`**: A class that holds the context for a chain of prompts, including inputs, outputs, and results.

- **`StepResult`**: A dataclass that holds the result of a prompt step, including the output, metadata, and execution time.

## Configuration

- `timeout`: Default is 300.0 seconds (5 minutes).

- `retry_count`: Default is 0 retries.

- `retry_delay`: Default is 1.0 second.

- `required`: Default is True.

- `skip_on_failure`: Default is False.

## Error Handling

Errors during execution are caught and raised as `ValueError` with a detailed message. The `PromptStep` class also logs the error type and includes it in the `StepResult`.

## Performance Considerations

- The `PromptStep` class is designed to handle asynchronous execution and retries, which can impact performance.

- Consider increasing the `timeout` if the AI model takes a long time to respond.

- Minimize the use of `transform_fn` if performance is critical, as it adds processing overhead.

## Architecture Analysis

## Architectural Analysis

### 1. Architectural Patterns

The code does not explicitly use a known design pattern such as MVC (Model-View-Controller), Observer, Factory, or others. It is a straightforward implementation of a class-based structure to handle individual steps in a prompt chain.

### 2. Code Organization

The code is organized into several parts:

- **Imports**: Standard library imports and internal module imports.

- **Configuration**: `StepConfig` class for configuring individual steps.

- **Main Class**: `PromptStep` class, which encapsulates the logic for a single step in the chain.
  - **Attributes**: Various attributes like `name`, `prompt_template`, `depends_on`, `transform_fn`, `config`, and `metadata`.
  - **Methods**:
    - `can_execute`: Checks if all dependencies are satisfied.
    - `get_missing_dependencies`: Lists missing dependencies.
    - `build_prompt`: Constructs the prompt using the context.
    - `execute`: Executes the step, handles retries, and captures metadata.

- **Helper Methods**: `**repr**` for string representation.

### 3. Data Flow

- **Initialization**: The `PromptStep` is initialized with various parameters.

- **Execution Flow**:
  - **Dependency Check**: Before executing, it checks if all dependencies are satisfied.
  - **Prompt Construction**: Constructs the prompt using the context and dependent outputs.
  - **Model Execution**: Calls the model function and handles retries on failure.
  - **Transformation**: Applies a transformation function if provided.
  - **Result Compilation**: Compiles the result and metadata.

- **Error Handling**: Errors during execution are caught, and detailed error messages are returned.

### 4. Dependencies

- **Internal Dependencies**: The `PromptStep` class depends on `ChainContext` for context management and `StepConfig` for configuration.

- **External Dependencies**: The `model_fn` is an external dependency provided to the `execute` method.

### 5. Interfaces

- **Public Interface**: The `PromptStep` class provides a public interface for initialization and execution.

- **Configuration Interface**: The `StepConfig` class provides configuration options for individual steps.

### 6. Extensibility

- **Configuration**: The `StepConfig` class allows for easy configuration of individual steps.

- **Transformation**: The `transform_fn` attribute allows for flexible transformation of the AI output.

- **New Steps**: Adding new steps involves creating a new instance of `PromptStep` with the appropriate configurations and dependencies.

### 7. Design Principles

- **SOLID Principles**: The code adheres to SOLID principles by separating concerns and ensuring single responsibilities for each class and method.

- **Separation of Concerns**: The `PromptStep` handles the execution of a single step, while `ChainContext` manages the context for the chain.

### 8. Potential Improvements

- **Configuration Management**: Consider using a more robust configuration management system, possibly leveraging a library like `pydantic` for better configuration handling.

- **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to provide more detailed feedback and logs.

- **Testing**: Implement unit tests to cover different scenarios and edge cases.

- **Documentation**: Improve documentation to clearly explain the usage and configuration of `PromptStep`.

Overall, the code is well-structured and follows good software design principles, making it extensible and maintainable.
