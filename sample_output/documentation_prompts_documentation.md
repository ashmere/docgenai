# Documentation: documentation_prompts.py

## Overview

The `DocumentationPromptBuilder` class in the `src/docgenai/prompts/documentation_prompts.py` file is designed to facilitate the generation of comprehensive, clear, and well-structured documentation for Python code. This class provides a structured approach to documenting code, ensuring that all essential aspects are covered in a systematic manner.

## Key Components

The `DocumentationPromptBuilder` class includes the following main components:

- **`DOCUMENTATION_SECTIONS`**: A string that lists the core documentation sections that should be included in the generated documentation.

- **`DOCUMENTATION_FORMATTING_RULES`**: Additional formatting rules specific to the main documentation.

- **`build_prompt` method**: A method that constructs a documentation generation prompt based on the provided source code and file path.

## Architecture

The `DocumentationPromptBuilder` class operates by first detecting the programming language from the file extension if not provided explicitly. It then constructs a detailed documentation prompt that includes sections such as Overview, Key Components, Architecture, Usage Examples, Dependencies, Configuration, Error Handling, and Performance Considerations.
These sections are populated with clear, text explanations rather than diagrams, ensuring the documentation is both readable and accessible.

## Usage Examples

To use the `DocumentationPromptBuilder` class, you would typically instantiate it and call the `build_prompt` method with the appropriate code and file path. Here's a simple example:

```python
builder = DocumentationPromptBuilder()
code = """
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
"""
file_path = "src/my_module/math_functions.py"
prompt = builder.build_prompt(code, file_path)
print(prompt)

This would generate a detailed documentation prompt tailored to the provided code and file path.

```

## Dependencies

The `DocumentationPromptBuilder` class relies on the `BasePromptBuilder` class from the same module. Ensure that `BasePromptBuilder` is properly imported before using `DocumentationPromptBuilder`.

## Configuration

No specific configuration options are required for the `DocumentationPromptBuilder` class. However, the `build_prompt` method allows for the specification of a `language` parameter, which defaults to `None` and auto-detects the language from the file extension if not provided.

## Error Handling

The `DocumentationPromptBuilder` class handles errors by raising exceptions when the provided code or file path is invalid. Ensure that the code and file path are correctly specified to avoid errors.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance, consider using the `DocumentationPromptBuilder` class with well-structured and commented code. This ensures that the generated documentation is comprehensive and easy to understand.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively utilize the `DocumentationPromptBuilder` class to generate detailed and informative documentation for your Python code.

## Architecture Analysis

## Architectural Analysis

### 1. Architectural Patterns

The code provided does not explicitly use a known design pattern such as MVC (Model-View-Controller), Observer, Factory, or others. Instead, it follows a simple object-oriented approach with a class `DocumentationPromptBuilder` that inherits from `BasePromptBuilder`.
This suggests a more straightforward and less complex design, which might be suitable for a smaller project or for educational purposes.

### 2. Code Organization

The code is organized into a single file, `documentation_prompts.py`, which contains the `DocumentationPromptBuilder` class and some constants. The `DocumentationPromptBuilder` class is responsible for building a documentation prompt based on the provided code and file path. The constants `DOCUMENTATION_SECTIONS` and `DOCUMENTATION_FORMATTING_RULES` are defined within the class.

### 3. Data Flow

The data flow in this system is straightforward. The `build_prompt` method takes in a string of code, a file path, and optionally a language specification. It uses these inputs to generate a documentation prompt string, which is returned by the method.

### 4. Dependencies

The system has one external dependency: `pathlib.Path` from the Python standard library. The `DocumentationPromptBuilder` class uses `Path` to handle file paths.

### 5. Interfaces

The public interface of the system is the `build_prompt` method of the `DocumentationPromptBuilder` class. This method is responsible for generating the documentation prompt based on the provided code and file path.

### 6. Extensibility

The code is designed to be easily extensible. For instance, if new documentation sections need to be added, they can be defined in the `DOCUMENTATION_SECTIONS` constant, and the `build_prompt` method can be modified to include these new sections. Similarly, if new formatting rules are needed, they can be added to the `DOCUMENTATION_FORMATTING_RULES` constant.

### 7. Design Principles

The code adheres to several design principles:

- **Separation of Concerns**: The `DocumentationPromptBuilder` class encapsulates the logic for building the documentation prompt, keeping the logic for generating prompts separate from other concerns like data handling or external interactions.

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The `DocumentationPromptBuilder` class has a single responsibility, which is to build the documentation prompt.

### 8. Potential Improvements

While the current design is simple and effective for its purpose, there are potential areas for improvement:

- **Configuration**: The system does not currently support configuration options or environment variables. Adding support for these could make the system more flexible and adaptable to different environments.

- **Language Detection**: The current implementation auto-detects the language from the file extension. For more robust language detection, the system could integrate with language-specific parsers or APIs.

- **Error Handling**: The `build_prompt` method does not include error handling for invalid inputs or external dependencies. Adding robust error handling could improve the system's resilience.

## Conclusion

The provided code is a straightforward implementation of a documentation prompt builder using Python's object-oriented capabilities. While it does not use complex design patterns, it is well-organized, has a clear data flow, and adheres to fundamental design principles. Potential improvements could enhance its flexibility and robustness.
