How one breakthrough model eliminates the need for separate AI systems while delivering superior performance across text, images, and reasoning tasks.


Last month, I decided to build DocuMentor — a tool that helps developers create technical documentation. You paste in your code, and it generates clear explanations, creates helpful diagrams, and suggests improvements. Simple enough, right?

I ended up managing multiple AI models just to make it work. One model to analyze the code and write explanations, another to generate architectural diagrams, a third to understand and critique the diagrams I’d created, and yet another to suggest code improvements.

The result? Painfully slow responses, constantly managing different APIs, and integration nightmares. When one model went down, the whole thing fell apart.

Then I Discovered MMaDA
Frustrated and about to abandon the project, I stumbled across MMaDA on Hugging Face.


MMaDA on Huggingface
The demo looked too good to be true: one model handling code analysis, documentation writing, diagram creation, and even critiquing its own work. All with consistent quality.


One Model, Everything
Instead of this complex workflow where I’d send code to one model for analysis, extract key concepts, send those to an image generator, then analyze the results with a vision model, I could do this:

# The MMaDA way - one model for everything
model = MMaDAModel.from_pretrained("Gen-Verse/MMaDA-8B-Base")
# Analyze code and create documentation
code_explanation = model.generate_text("Explain this Python function and its purpose: " + my_code)
# Create a relevant diagram from the same model
diagram = model.generate_image("System architecture diagram showing how this function fits in the overall application")
# Analyze the diagram we just created
analysis = model.understand_image(diagram)
Wait, what? The same model that understood my code could also create a relevant diagram AND analyze what it created?


The model is loaded directly from Hugging Face meaning you download and run the model weights locally.

The beauty of discovering tools like MMaDA is that they lower the barrier to actually building AI applications. Speaking of getting started with AI development, my comprehensive guide to building your first AI app walks you through every step using completely free tools.

Building DocuMentor 2.0: The Rebuild
I decided to rebuild my app using only MMaDA. Here’s how it went:

The setup was ridiculously simple. One repository, one set of dependencies, and within an hour I had something working.

I threw a complex React component at it and asked it to create documentation. MMaDA understood the component’s purpose, created a visual representation of the data flow, and even suggested how to improve the component’s design. All from one model, all in one conversation.

def create_documentation(code_snippet):
    # One API call instead of four
    response = model.generate_with_reasoning(
        prompt=f"Create comprehensive documentation for this code including a visual diagram: {code_snippet}",
        include_reasoning=True
    )

    # The model thinks through the process
    print("Model's reasoning:", response.reasoning)

    return {
        'explanation': response.text,
        'diagram': response.image,
        'suggestions': response.improvements
    }
The reasoning feature was particularly good. I could actually see MMaDA thinking through the code, understanding the architecture, deciding what kind of diagram would be most helpful, and then creating it.


Building a Complete Feature
Let me show you how I built the “Smart Code Explainer” feature that previously required all those different models:

class SmartCodeExplainer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = MMaDAModel.from_pretrained("Gen-Verse/MMaDA-8B-Base")

    def explain_code_completely(self, code, context=""):
        # Step 1: Understand and explain the code
        explanation = self.model.generate_text(
            f"Explain this code in detail, including its purpose and how it works: {code}"
        )

        # Step 2: Create supporting visuals
        diagram = self.model.generate_image(
            f"Create a flowchart or diagram showing how this code works: {code}"
        )

        # Step 3: Analyze and improve
        analysis = self.model.understand_image(diagram)
        suggestions = self.model.generate_text(
            f"Based on this code and its visual representation, suggest improvements: {code}. Visual shows: {analysis}"
        )

        return {
            'explanation': explanation,
            'diagram': diagram,
            'visual_analysis': analysis,
            'improvements': suggestions
        }

When comparing AI models, understanding their underlying capabilities is essential. I break down these differences in my comprehensive guide to Claude.ai’s models and performance characteristics

If You Are Still Here 👉 Try It Yourself
Here’s how you can test this in under 5 minutes:

The easiest way to see this in action is through MMaDA’s Hugging Face Demo. Try asking it something like “Explain how a REST API works and create a diagram showing the request-response cycle.” Watch it generate both a clear explanation and a relevant technical diagram that actually matches the explanation.

If you want to run it locally, the setup is straightforward:

# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/Gen-Verse/MMaDA
cd MMaDA
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# Test with your own prompts
For a quick integration test, you can also work directly with the model:

# If you want to integrate directly
import requests
response = requests.post("your-mmada-endpoint", json={
    "prompt": "Explain this database schema and show a visual ERD",
    "include_image": True
})
# Get both text explanation and entity relationship diagram
When One Model > Multiple Models
MMaDA shines when you’re building content platforms, educational tools, developer documentation systems, or prototyping multimodal demos.


I find it to be powerful for small to medium applications where you want to avoid the complexity overhead of multiple model integrations.

Getting Started: The 30-Minute Challenge
Here’s my challenge to you: Spend 30 minutes building something with MMaDA that would have taken you days with multiple models.

Try building a personal documentation generator where you input a code snippet and get both an explanation and an architecture diagram. Or create a learning assistant where you ask a technical question and get both an answer and a visual aid. Maybe build a code explainer that takes your code and produces a breakdown with a flowchart.

Start with the online demo to get a feel for the capabilities. Then clone the GitHub repo, run python app.py, and build something cool.

If you’re building anything that needs multiple AI capabilities, try MMaDA first. Start with the demo, play with the examples, and see if it clicks for your use case.
