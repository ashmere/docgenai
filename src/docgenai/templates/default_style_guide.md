When generating documentation, please adhere to the following style guide:

- **Tone**: Professional, clear, and concise.
- **Audience**: Assume the reader is a software developer with intermediate experience.
- **Visual Elements**: Ensure any visual elements are simple, easy to understand, and directly relevant to the code being analyzed.
- **Explanations**: Break down complex topics into smaller, digestible parts. Use code snippets where appropriate.
